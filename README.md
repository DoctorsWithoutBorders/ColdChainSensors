#Cold Chain Sensors#
A temperature tracking system aimed to aid medicine transportation when temperature requirements are critical. Sensors located in transportation packages transmit temperature data to a android based device acting as a gateway which in turn communicates to a cloud based backend. With access to current temperature data for each package through a web client responsible staff can take action and supports staff in the decision process when evaluating medicine quality.
